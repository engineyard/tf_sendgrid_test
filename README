== Tres Fiestas Mailgun Test

this is an app for testing a mail service, in this case mailgun.

at the time of writing this they only have part of the API exposed so you will need to manually update your application.rb

config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
      :authentication => :plain,
      :address => "smtp.mailgun.org",
      :port => 25,
      :domain => "UPDATE_ME",
      :user_name => "UPDATE_ME",
      :password => "UPDATE_ME"
}
